# max-min-alternating-sort
This was a coding problem I was given on HackerRank for an application coding challenge. I ran out of time during the test so I spent a few extra minutes to finish it on my own. 

I felt pretty stupid that I didn't finish it in time since it wasn't that difficult of a problem. I spent too much time trying to look it up instead of just trying to solve it by myself.
